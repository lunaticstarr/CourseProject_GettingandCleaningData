# CourseProject_GettingandCleaningData

Welcome!  

This repository is for the course project of [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/) from Coursera, basically what this project does is to tidy up an existing dataset for further analysis.  
  
  
There are five components within the project and three of them can be found in this repository:  
  
1. README.md -- the file you are reading now, which explains what's happening here.  

2. The raw data -- the dataset we are going to tidy up. You can download it [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) or check the original [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data is obtained.  

3. Script for performing the analysis.R -- the R script for performing the whole tidy up process. Check more of the details within the file in this repository!  

4. The tidy dataset -- download the raw data and run the R script, this tidy dataset will be generated in your working directory (TidyDataset.txt and TidyAverage.txt).  

5. Codebook.Rmd -- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that have been performed to clean up the data.    


Generally, I hope that I have done a good job on this project and successfully created my first tidy dataset!
